# wrfToNN

### Description:

This program reads NetCDF files generated from the model WRF and rearrange the data so that they can be used as inputs to a neural network. An interpoler running on GPU written in Cuda is provided and can interpolate data between grids of different size. 

This program was implemented in the context of using neural networks for atmospheric data retrieval.
